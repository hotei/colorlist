[This go package] [4] started as a fork of github.com/btracey/colorlist.  Since then
it has diverged enough that retaining it as a fork is probably not useful.  Brendan
decided to change his repository name to colors so I've un-hitched this from
his original repository which is now marked 'deprecated'.  This is now being
re-issued as a new repository : github.com/hotei/colorlist.

The main difference between the packages is that Brendans provides pre-named
variables representing colors.  For example colors.Black is an RGBA value in
his package. I chose to go the route of color lookup tables.  The same value in
my package would be colorlist.ColorVal("black").

There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  In his system a bad 
color name results in a compile time error.  In mine it results in a default 
color (black) being substituted but the program continues to run.  An advantage
of my system is that configuration files can easily map colors from strings to
RGBA values.  You can also add your own colors to the maps on the fly and even
change the existing color values if you wish.

### Features

This package contains a list of about 150 standard colors in image.color RGBA format.

The first set (16) colors is specified by the [HTML 4 standard][1]

The second set of  colors are specified by the [CSS3 standard][3]

[Color-book.org][2] is a web site with many colors displayed and listed in
both rgb and cmyk forms.
